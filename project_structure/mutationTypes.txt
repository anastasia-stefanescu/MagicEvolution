# mutation rolls are independent
fov mutation: increases or decreases current fov by at most a fraction p of the current fov (p found in SimulationParameters.AIParameters.MutationParameters.visionFOVMaxChange)
rayCountCode mutation: increases or decreases by 1
range: increases or decreases current range by at most a fraction p of the current range (p found in SimulationParameters.AIParameters.MutationParameters.visionRangeMaxChange)
