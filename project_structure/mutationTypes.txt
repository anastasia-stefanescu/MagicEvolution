==== VisionGenome ====
# mutation rolls are independent
fov mutation: increases or decreases current fov by at most a fraction p of the current fov (p found in SimulationParameters.AIParameters.MutationParameters.visionFOVMaxChange)
rayCountCode mutation: increases or decreases by 1
range: increases or decreases current range by at most a fraction p of the current range (p found in SimulationParameters.AIParameters.MutationParameters.visionRangeMaxChange)


==== NeuralNetworkGenome ====
# mutation rolls are independent and applied in the following order
create synapse: picks a random pair of unconnected neurons (if one exists) and creates a synapse between them of a random weight between -s and s (a=SimulationParameters.AIParameters.synapseMaxAbsoluteWeight)
modify synapse: picks a random synapse and changes its weight by at most a fraction p of the current weight, clamping the result between -s and s
(p=SimulationParameters.AIParameters.MutationParameters.synapseModificationMaxChange, s=SimulationParameters.AIParameters.synapseMaxAbsoluteWeight)
evolve synapse: picks a random synapse and turns it into 2 new ones, with a new neuron in between. the synapse connected to the original source will have a weight equal to the original one's, while the other new synapse will have a weight of 1. the new neuron will have the identity activation function
remove synapse: picks a random synapse and removes it
modify (hidden) neuron: picks a random hidden neuron, if one exists, and changes its activation function to another one at random
remove (hidden) neuron: picks a random hidden neuron, if one exists, and removes it along with all synapses connected to it
