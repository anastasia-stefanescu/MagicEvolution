# Magic Evolution

A game written using C# in Godot that creates a simulation that can be observed, but not modified, of a world inhabited by Wizbits - small magic creatures that are supposed to evolve by reproducing themselves.
The purpose is to observe their evolution accross multiple generations, how the Wizbits that are better adapted to their surroundings survive for longer and reproduce more, leading to better offspring.

The Wizbits can move freely around, need to consume Mana pellets to sustain themselves, reproduce, and attack each other using spells. 
Their behaviour is dictated by an AI - a neural network created uniquely for each Wizbit, which can also evolve when new generations are created.
